Small WDTV application to hack the root password

Run this application including the .app inside a usb stick

Once run it will reset the root password of your WDTV device to 'hackme'

Then login via telnet or ssh as 'root' using the password 'hackme':

 ssh root@192.168.0.2 (check its IP on Network Settings)
 type 'hackme' when asked for a password

And that's it!

You can now reset the password to your own using the command 'passwd'

Happy hacking ;^)
