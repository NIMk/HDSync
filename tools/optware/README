Optware port for the WDLXTV Firmware

For more information on Optware and all the software it provides:
see http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/Optware/HomePage

This optware port is made for the WDLXTV firmware
 running on WDTV HD Live hardware, see http://www.wdlxtv.com

Installs in 4 simple steps:
- format usb storage with ext3
- put the wdlxtv_optware.app.bin in it
- login from telnet or ssh 
- type optware-install.sh

Please note that:
- the usb storage *needs* to be ext3 formatted
  but this doesn't means that you need the ext3 version of firmware
- this port builds the /opt directory inside your usb storage
  (there could be more options in future, to use NFS for instance)
