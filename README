:      A network based sync-starter for multi-channel HD Video
:                                    by Denis Roio aka Jaromil

The digital video syncstarter software is developed and employed by
NIMk to provide synced playback of multiple videos on multiple
screens.

In the video art field there are many artworks requiring the real-time
synced playback of audio/video: HDSync provides such a functionality
for HD decoders, to sync HD video playback on multiple devices.

At NIMk we use to distribute multi-channel video artworks of artists
in our catalogue, send them to galleries for exhibition with simple
on/off activation.

** Usage and compatibility

This package won't be very useful unless you know how to reuse the
code or cross-compile it for Mips processors.  HDSync is been
developed in-house at NIMk on a specific hardware configuration (WD HD
Live) and runds on the WDLXTV firmware by B-rad.


** Development in progress

This release can synchronise the playback of multiple devices on the
same LAN: they can automatically handshake and start playing in sync,
restoring the sync at every loop. Empirical tests have shown that sync
will keep below 1 sec. difference, but we still didn't achieve frame
exact sync.

** Support and warranty

The purpose of this release is to make the project open source to
allow collaboration with developers interested: we release HDSync as
free and open source (GNU GPL v3) in the hope it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.

In case you need assistance to setup your own HD sync-starter, you can
contact us and ask a quote, see details on http://nimk.nl/syncstarter
