      A network based sync-starter for multi-channel HD Video


The digital video syncstarter software is developed and employed by
NIMk to provide synced playback of multiple videos on multiple
screens.

In the video art field there are many artworks requiring the real-time
synced playback of audio/video: HDSync provides such a functionality
for HD decoders, to sync HD video playback on multiple devices.

This is a work in progress.  This initial release is v0.1.

It probably won't be very useful unless you know how to reuse the code
or cross-compile it for Mips processors.  HDSync is been developed
in-house at NIMk on a specific hardware configuration (WDHDLive).

At NIMk we use to distribute multi-channel video artworks of artists
in our catalogue, send them to galleries for exhibition inside "plug
and play" solution with simple on/off activation; there are no
guarantees that HDSync is ready to do that for anyone else.

In fact, this software is just at beta stage, testing phase.

The purpose of this release is to make the project open source to
allow collaboration with developers interested: we release HDSync as
free and open source (GNU GPL v3) in the hope it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.

In case you need assistance to setup your own HD sync-starter, you can
