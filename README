:      A network based sync-starter for multi-channel HD Video
:                                    by Denis Roio aka Jaromil

The digital video syncstarter software is developed and employed at
the NIMk Artlab to provide synced playback of multiple videos on
multiple screens.

In the video art field there are many artworks requiring the real-time
synced playback of audio/video: HDSync provides such a functionality
for HD decoders, to sync HD video playback on multiple devices.

At NIMk we use to distribute multi-channel video artworks of artists
in our catalogue, send them to galleries for exhibition with simple
on/off activation.

More information on our R&D deparment: http://nimk.nl/eng/research

** Usage and compatibility

HDSync only works on a specific hardware configuration: WD HD Live
players running B-Rad's WDLXTV firmware, something artists themselves
can afford for approx 100EUR on the consumer market.

** Development in progress

This release can synchronise the playback of multiple channels
(virtually unlimited) on the same local network: hdsync can
automatically handshake and start playing in sync, restoring the sync
at every loop. Empirical tests show an error margin of 10-15 frames,
with further development we aim to achieve frame exact sync.

** Documentation

A user manual is online at ftp://ftp.dyne.org/hdsync/hdsync_manual.pdf

More documentation is included inside the doc/ directory

** Support and warranty

The purpose of this release is to make the project open source to
allow collaboration with developers interested: we release HDSync as
free and open source (GNU GPL v3) in the hope it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.

In case you need assistance to setup your own HD sync-starter, you can
