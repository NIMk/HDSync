* Background information

First of all be sure to read and understand the informations on the
[[http://www.wdlxtv.com][WDLXTV]] website. To run HDSync you'll need a *WDTV Live* device for
each video channel you are playing.

Be sure you have the *Live* model: the one with a network port on its
back (Ethernet RJ45)

Now, before proceeding with HDSync, download [[http://wiki.wdlxtv.com/Main_Page][B-Rad's firmware WDLXTV
Live]] and [[http://wiki.wdlxtv.com/Flashing_the_Firmware][flash it]] on your device. Once all this is set you can start
follow the instructions below.

* Prepare the Usb keys

To run HDSync on your WDTV Live device you need one USB stick for each
device (and therefore each video channel); the usb stick will contain
our software and the video to play.

First *format the usb sticks with a decent journaled filesystem like
the Linux Ext3* using tools like mkfs.ext3 from a GNU/Linux OS.

Then place our application (the *hdsync.app.bin* file) on the USB
sticks together with two configuration files, one of them needs to be
edited to set how many video channels you are playing.

 + Copy the *hdsync.app.bin* in the usb stick
 + Copy the *S00custom-options* conf file in the usb key
 + Copy the *hdsync.conf* in the usb stick
 + Edit hdsync.conf according to your setup (set *VIDEO_CHANNELS*)
 + Create a *videos/* directory in the usb stick, place your video

* Prepare the WDTV devices

To setup the WDTV devices you need to connect them to a monitor or
project and move around with the remote control, reach the settings
indicated below and change them with correct values

** Network settings
 + Set the configuration to *Manual*
 + Set the ip number of the box to a common C class IPv4[1]
 + Set the netmask to *255.0.0.0*

** Video settings
 + Set the *Video sequence* to *Normal*
 + Set the Browser display to *List mode*

[1] The IP is a numeric network address, a C class is determined by
    the last value of the series of numbers: be sure that the last and
    rightmost number changes, while all others stay the same. For
    further information please refer to common documentation on
    network administration.

* Connect your syncstarters

HDSync is made so that a complete setup will be extremely simple to
activate and deactivate: just using an ON/OFF switch, since that is
what works best when you want to leave your installation somewhere
like in an art gallery and give simple instructions to people.

Once you loaded the WDTV boxes with the HDSync software and got
everything configured, you will need to *connect them together via
ethernet cables* - and a hub if there are more than 2 channels.

Then connect each WDTV box via a video cable (Composite or HDMI) to
your monitor or beamer, then connect the audio to the amplifier.

Then obviously you need to connect all power cables for all electronic
device involved in this setup; we use to set everything on the same
power socket so that its *ON/OFF switch* will be the main for the
whole installation.

At last, make sure that all cable connections are well plugged and...

* Switch ON!

If everything went well so far you'll see the WDTV boot screens
popping up, then arriving at the menu they will automatically select
the video playback browser and stop on its first selection, wait half
a minute, then start.

In this phase you can notice that network leds are blinking: in case
you are using an hub you can count as many lights as many devices you
have (else there is a problem in the way you connected the network).

If you have a computer and want to monitor the sync operation "from
inside", you can assign yourself an IP in the range of those you used
for the boxes, then log into the devices via ssh and read their log in
*/tmp/hdsync.log*, realtime updates can be watches with the command:

: tail -f /tmp/hdsync.log

This way you can also debug the software behaviour for errors; however
you won't need this unless you are developing HDSync, if you have any
troubles these are likely due to cables and setup of files on the USB
sticks. *Happy Hacking*!

* Terms and Conditions

HDSync is Free Software and you can use it, modify it and redistribute
it as you want, provided you read and agree with all terms of the GNU
GPL v3 license.

If you use this software for your own art projects, this doesn't mean

please express your appreciation with a kind donation.

If you need support using HDSync, distributing artworks or producing
installations with it, you can certainly *hire our services*: we can
offer assistance and development services as a professional art
institute with several years of experience in the fields of video and
media art.
