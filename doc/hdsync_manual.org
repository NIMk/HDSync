* Background information

First of all be sure to read and understand the informations on the
[[http://www.wdlxtv.com][WDLXTV]] website. To run HDSync you'll need a *WDTV Live* device for
each video channel you are playing.

Be sure you have the *Live* model: the one with a network port on its
back (Ethernet RJ45)

* Prepare the devices

Before proceeding with HDSync you need to upgrade your WDTV device
with the [[http://wdlxtv.com/][WDLXTV]] homebrew firmware developed by B-Rad and his team: you
need to do this because the firmware developed by the community is, as
usual, way better than the one distributed by the company.

Flashing the new firmware into the device is fairly easy, detailed
instructions on how to do that are available on the [[http://wiki.wdlxtv.com/Main_Page][WDLXTV Wiki]].

Be sure to choose a firmware that matches your device model. HDSync
has been tested only on WDTV Live HD devices which are best supported
by the WDLXTV firmware series *1.02.21*. There are two kinds of
firmware, one is LIVE and the other Ext3: both will work, depending
from how you use your device, the simpliest option is to use the LIVE
version unless you have more particular requirements that you are
aware of, beyond the use of HDSync.

To setup the WDTV devices you need to connect them to a monitor or
projector and operate them with the remote control: that's all what is
needed to upgrade the firmware once it is loaded on a USB stick.

* Prepare the Usb keys

To run HDSync on your WDTV Live device you need one USB stick for each
device (and therefore each video channel); the usb stick will contain
our software and the video to play.

First *format the usb sticks with a journaled filesystem like the
Linux Ext3* using tools like mkfs.ext3 from a GNU/Linux OS.

Then place our *hdsync.app.bin* file on the USB sticks together with
the *hdsync.conf* configuration file. The configuration is a plain
text file that needs to be edited: set how many video channels you are
playing (*TOTAL_CHANNELS*), the unique channel number for this usb
stick starting from 1 (*HDSYNC_CHANNEL*) and on what kind of network
the sync-starters will connect: (*HDSYNC_NETWORK*) if the IP will be
dynamically assigned (DYNAMIC) or if the devices are connected on
their own local network without a DHCP server (STATIC).

At last, create a *video/* directory and put a video file inside. At
the moment only one video file is supported, the first one in the sync
directory list, so we recommend to put only one file in that directory
to be sure of which one will play.

* Connect

HDSync is made so that a complete setup will be extremely simple to
activate and deactivate: just using an ON/OFF switch, since that is
what works best when you want to leave your installation somewhere
like in an art gallery and give simple instructions to people.

Once you loaded the WDTV boxes with the HDSync software and got
everything configured, you will need to *connect them together via
ethernet cables* - and a hub if there are more than 2 channels.

Then connect each WDTV box via a video cable (Composite or HDMI) to
your monitor or beamer, then connect the audio to the amplifier.

Then obviously you need to connect all power cables for all electronic
device involved in this setup; we use to set everything on the same
power socket so that its *ON/OFF switch* will be the main for the
whole installation.

At last, make sure that all cable connections are well plugged and...

* Switch ON!

If everything went well so far you'll see the WDTV boot screens
popping up, then arriving at the menu they will automatically select
the video playback browser and stop on its first selection, wait half
a minute, then start.

In this phase you can notice that network leds are blinking: in case
you are using an hub you can count as many lights as many devices you
have (else there is a problem in the way you connected the network).

Finally, if for some reason you don't remember the password to access
your WD devices, you can reset it using the *wdtvhack.app.bin*
application we provide from our repository: use it on a separate usb
stick and boot with it once, the root password will be reset to
*hackme*.

Then if you want to monitor the sync operation "from inside", you can
assign yourself an IP in the range of those you used for the boxes,
then log into the devices via ssh and read their log in
*/tmp/hdsync.log*, realtime updates can be watches with the command:

: tail -f /tmp/hdsync.log

This way you can also debug the software behaviour for errors; however
you won't need this unless you are debugging HDSync. At last, if you
have any troubles these are likely due to cables and setup of files on
the USB sticks. *Happy Hacking*!

are welcome to express your appreciation :)

If you need support using HDSync, distributing artworks or producing
installations with it, you can certainly *hire our services*: we can
offer assistance and development services as a professional art
institute with several years of experience in the fields of video and
